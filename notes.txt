concepts
  package is a folder that is maintained by java
  access qualifier (same package classes vs different package )  
   to use different package classes we need to import
 java compilation -- command - javac
 java class run -- comannd -- java 
 class path -cp 
   Where java classes are present. folder where we compile both non-packaged or packaged classes(byte code)

-d option to save the class file into desired folder  

Most common scenario
   -- compile a java code that calls other classes from anywhere and save the compiled class in a specified directory

   javac -d <<path to where we want classes to be stored>> -cp <<path where classes are stored>> pathToTheJavaFileToBeCompiled
   javac -d bin -cp bin src\examples\Practise.java


   -- run a java class from anywhere
   java -cp <<path where classes are stored>> nameOfTheClass
